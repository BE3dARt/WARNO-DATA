## Introduction
Eugen Systems have published their raw game data of WARNO for the first time in their Milestone MURAT. This project aims at understanding and interpreting these values for the ultimate goal: **WARNO API**

Through the whole documentary disclosure widgets, like the following, can be found. Click them to get information on the given variable.

## Useful Information
WARNO has some twists and turns when it comes down to comprehensibility. These are some useful tools to guide you through the jungle of WARNO data.

### Constant Factors
Some values presented in `.ndf` files need to be multiplied by a constant factor. I know of **two** constants so far that are defined in `GDConstantes.ndf`:
* MultiplicateurMetreRTSVersDistanceFeedbackTactique: **1.0 div 2.83** &mdash; Needs to be multiplied with the *distance* to receive accurate results. E.g. 6000 m \* (**1.0 / 2.83**) = 2120 m
* MultiplicateurMetreRTSVersVitesseTactiquePourVehicule: **0.45 div 1.0** &mdash; Needs to be multiplied with the *speed* to receive accurate results. E.g. 120 km/h \* (**0.45 / 1.0**) = 54 km/h

### Calculate Road Speed
In `UniteDescriptor.ndf` there are values called *VitesseCombat* and *RealRoadSpeed* which are not being used. Instead, we should use *MaxSpeed* which represents the off-road speed. Compute (*MaxSpeed* + *MaxSpeed* \* *SpeedBonusOnRoad*) \* *MultiplicateurMetreRTSVersVitesseTactiquePourVehicule* to get the true road speed.

### Calculate Autonomy
Autonomy states how far a unit can move until it runs out of fuel. In previous titles, this was measured in seconds, however, in WARNO it is specifically stated in *kilometres*. For planes, *Autonomy* is equivalent to their *FuelMoveDuration*. For ground units, the following calculation holds very well. Be aware that this calculation was created using multiple results and searching a common pattern, hence the strange factor. Round up to the nearest integer if the first decimal place of the result is bigger than 5.

*Autonomy* = *MaxSpeed* \* *FuelMoveDuration* \* *0.0000975*

### Accuracy
Accuracy is defined as the probability of landing a successful shot on an enemy unit. Be aware that this whole accuracy system is not yet understood fully and assumptions are being made.\
To start off with a fact, *HitRollRuleDescriptor* in `Ammunition.ndf` describes the accuracy for each ammunition type individually. This descriptor consists of:

* *BaseCriticModifier*
* *BaseEffectModifier*
* *BaseHitValueModifiers*
* *HitModifierList*

My best guess is that *BaseCriticModifier* and *BaseEffectModifier* are only used for the probability of triggering critical effects like "reseting targeting computer" and so on. We will ignore them both for now. What we are really interested in is *BaseHitValueModifiers* and *HitModifierList*.

Now, for every shot a dice is rolled which will define if this particular shot is a hit or a miss. Just a random number would be too boring, we want to spice up the outcome with some parameters. My understanding is that *HitModifierList* is exactly that: Parameters for the dice roll. This list consists of the following items: Precision, DistanceToTarget, SuccesiveShots and Suppress. Now, what do these mean? Do note though, these are pure guesses.

* *Precision*: It think it is the value when active *BaseHitValueModifiers* are summed up. Basically this is the base chance of a hit. If the target has Electronic countermeasures (ECM), subtract its value from the base hit chance.
* *DistanceToTarget*: In `HitRollConstants.ndf` there is a list called *RangeModifiersTable*. It might state how to translate the distance to this parameterâ€™s value. First off, you would calculate *distance_to_target* / *weapon_maxRange* to get a ratio which needs to be plugged into the left side of the list. Read out the corresponding right side to get the value for this parameter. So if the target is close to the attacker, it will yield a higher parameter value.
* *SuccesiveShots*: There is a list in `HitRollConstants.ndf` called *SuccessiveHitModifiersTable*. This parameter will yield *0* if the target has not been hit yet, *1* for the first successive shot and *2* for every greater successive shot count.
* *Suppress*: Current suppress damage this unit has.

In `HitRollConstants.ndf` a developer described the dice roll calculation to be: *Success if roll > RollSuccessThreshold - modifiersum*. I interpret this to be: *Hit if random_generated_number (RNG) > RollSuccessThreshold - sum_of_every_parameter_in_HitModifierList*

If you look closely into the `HitRollConstants.ndf`, you will notice three types of dice rolls: *Hit*, *Pierce* and *critic*:

* *Hit*: Describes the dice roll for the hit probability we just studied above.
* *Pierce*: Describes the dice roll for the probability that an kinetic AP ammunition will pierce through armor. However, there is not much else known about this dice roll for now.
* *Critic*: Describes the dice roll for the probability that this shot will trigger critical effects which will render units useless for a given time.

Currently, the only way units differ from one another is through *EBaseHitValueModifier/Idling* and *EBaseHitValueModifier/Moving* of *BaseHitValueModifiers* in `Ammunition.ndf`. These values are the ones which represent the unit's *Accuracy* reading in the armory. However, be aware that the accuracy is displayed **per salvo**. You would need to multiply these values with *NbTirParSalves* in `Ammunition.ndf` to get the in-game displayed results.

### Armor
For every unit armor is individually defined in `UniteDescriptor.ndf` by the variables **ArmorDescriptorFront**, **ArmorDescriptorSides**, **ArmorDescriptorRear** and **ArmorDescriptorTop**. They can hold many more strings but these are the ones used in vanilla WARNO:

* **ArmorDescriptor_Batiment_1**: Used for buildings
* **ArmorDescriptor_Infanterie_1**: Used for Infantry; Can't receive armor-piercing (AP) damage, therefore in-game armory shows zero armor. However, there are multiple damage reductions present against various non-AP ammunition types.
* **ArmorDescriptor_Vehicule_1**: Used for vehicles; equivalent to *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_1*.
* **ArmorDescriptor_Vehicule_leger**: Used for vehicles; Receives damage from **every** ammunition. Usually more than double the amount of damage received than *ArmorDescriptor_Vehicule_1*.
* **ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_1** to **ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_20**: Used for vehicles;  Having blindage over 2 is utterly important: Going from *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_1* to *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_2* **halves** the AP damage received (exception to this rule follow shortly). After that, it is only decreasing by small amounts.
* **ArmorDescriptor_Helico_1** to **ArmorDescriptor_Helico_3**: Used on helicopters and planes; *ArmorDescriptor_Helico_1* is equivalent to *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_1*. Using *ArmorDescriptor_Helico_2* at least **halves** the damage received. After that, it is also only decreasing by small amounts.

These strings are referencing `ArmorDescriptor.ndf`, which itself references another file called `DamageResistance.ndf`. In there a giant table can be found listing every damage outcome of every weapon versus every armor. Some voices doubt the reliability of this table, others think it to be an export of WARNO's damage calculation.

This infamous list is no where near of following a strict pattern. For example, like before, stating that *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_1* to *ArmorDescriptor_Blindage_2* halves the AP damage is technically wrong when facing an AP missile or, according to the list, when facing tank cannons with more than 30 AP. In-game armory will always state the armor against a 1 AP threat.

### Armor-Piercing (AP) Damage
We need to distinguish between HE(AT) and Kinetic (KE). HE(AT) damage does **not** decrease with range, however, Kinetic (KE) does.\
Every ammunition type is defined in `Ammunition.ndf`. If \[Kinetic\] is listed in the *TraitsToken*-array, it means that this ammunition type is kinetic. If there is no such tag, the ammunition type is HE(AT).

#### HE(AT)
If the ammunition type is not Kinetic (KE), the index of the variable *Arme* will be the AP damage value of the weapon (E.g. Arme = TDamageTypeRTTI(Family="ap" Index=11) will mean an AP damage of 11).

#### Kinetic (KE)
The AP value of Kinetic (KE) ammunition **in-game** is given at the weapon's maximum range. In `Ammunition.ndf`, however, it is given at point-blank range. Therefore, we need to calculate it first:

*AP_max_range = AP_point_blank - (max_range / range_factor)*

* *AP_max_range*: AP damage at maximum range.
* *AP_point_blank*: AP damage at point-blank equivalent to the index defined in **Arme**.
* *max_range*: Maximal range defined in **PorteeMaximale**, multiplied with the corresponding constant factor.
* *range_factor*: Defined as the amount of AP damage decrease over a given range. To find this value we need to look at to what **DamageTypeEvolutionOverRangeDescriptor** is pointing to in `DamageStairTypeEvolutionOverRangeDescriptor.ndf`.\
E.g. *~/DamageTypeEvolutionOverRangeDescriptor_AP1_1Km* points to **Distance= 175.0, AP= 1.0**. In this case the AP damage decreases **1 point every 175m**.

### Experience & Veterancy
What experience scheme is currently being used can be seen under *ExperienceLevelsPackDescriptor* in `UniteDescriptor.ndf`. This string is a reference to `ExperienceLevels.ndf` where all schemes are defined. However, at the moment every unit uses the following experience scheme:
* *Level 0 (POOR)*: Time in-between salves = *115%*, Precision = *-25*, Suppress Damage = *125%*
* *Level 1 (TRAINED)*: Everything at standard
* *Level 2 (VETERAN)*: Time in-between salves = *85%*, Precision = *+15*, Suppress Damage = *75%*
* *Level 3 (ELITE*: Time in-between salves = *66%*, Precision = *+25*, Suppress Damage = *50%*

Furthermore, only armed units can gain Experience (described by *CanWinExperience*).\
As outlined in `Experience.ndf`, *ExperienceGainBySecond* and *ExperienceMultiplierBonusOnKill* are set to 0 and 1 equivalently. This means, at least for now, units are either not able to level up or they only gain experience by killing.

### Stress, Suppression, Cohesion and Morale
**Stress** and **suppression** are one and the same variable. In-game it is called *stress* and in the `.ndf` files it is mostly called *suppression*. Unlike Wargame: Red Dragon, this value is not shown in the WARNO UI. Instead, the current cohesion level is displayed.\
**Moral** is poorly understood. The fact that it is only non-zero for planes makes it hard to believe that it is a system that has any impact in-game, if any. It might very well be a leftover from a previous game.\
**Cohesion** is a direct effect of suppression. There are four levels which are described in `EffetsSurUnite.ndf`. Each comes with its own debuffs.

Which suppression system is being used is individually defined in `UniteDescriptor.ndf` under *SuppressDamageLevelsPack*. This variable is a reference to `DamageLevels.ndf` in which the following can be found: Every system has six different suppression levels (*calm*, *engaged*, *worried*, *stressed*, *shaken* and (*panicked* or *pinned*)), being triggered at different suppress damage levels defined by *Value*. Note that *Value* is most likely only the modifier for another variable, like the maximum amount of suppression damage. Each suppression level comes with custom debuffs: Morale is being modified (*MoralModifier*), chance of hitting the target is decreased (*HitRollModifier*) and *EffectsPacks* are being added. *EffectsPacks* can hold multiple effects, but the most important is the cohesion being changed. Its debuffs are outlined in `EffetsSurUnite.ndf`.

Suppression damage decreases over time. The following variables describe this behavior. They can be found in `UniteDescriptor.ndf` for every unit and are all references to `DamageModules.ndf`.
* *GroundUnit_SuppressDamagesRegenRatioList*: Array detailing how much suppression damage is being recovered over a given time period: *[Time, Suppression damage recovered]*
* *GroundUnit_SuppressDamagesRegenRatioOutOfRange*: How many seconds need to pass until suppression damage recovery starts.
* *GroundUnit_MaxSuppressionDamages*: Maximum suppression damage that can be received, however, it is unknown what happens if this threshold is being exceeded.

*SuppressDamages* in `Ammunition.ndf` describes how much suppress damage a weapon can generate. I strongly believe that the amount of suppress damage *received* is the same for all units because *MaxSuppressionDamages* is set to 1000 for every unit type and there is no multiplier mentioned in `UniteDescriptor.ndf` whatsoever.

## Division Rules

## Special Thanks
I wanted to thank the following people. Whithout them, this project would have gone nowhere:
* **eMeM** over on Discord for the *calculation of the road speed*, a guess on *recource tickets*, definition of *CanShootOnPosition*, help with *experience & veterancy* and the discussion over *stress, suppression, cohesion and morale*.
* **unipus** over on Discord for pointing me in the right direction to understand *AP damage for kinetic weapons*.
* **gagarin** over on Discord for helping me finding the *filter by category*.
* **Iris** over on Discord for helping me getting in-game displayed *accuracy* right.
* **Terminus Est** over on Discord for defining *Salves*, *SalvoStockIndex*, *YulBoneOrdinal*, *NbFx*, *HasMainSalvo* and *OutOfRangeTrackingDuration* in `WeaponDescriptor.ndf` and having a discussion with me about the accuracy calculation.
